# Note: We are ignoring android/ and ios/ because this is a managed Expo project (prebuild).
# If you eject or use continuous native generation (CNG) locally, you might want to unignore them slightly differently.
# But for a pure managed airflow, we ignore them or treat them as generated.
# Given the user context "Expo SDK 52+", likely managed. I will add standard RN ignores just in case they stick around.
